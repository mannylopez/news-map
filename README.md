Created a CSV with 10 stories, converted it to GeoJSON, and used Fetch to read it as an object. Now I can define a binding and point it to this object.

Ended up not defining a binding. Used `forEach` to add the coordinates to the map.

The stories and pins now populate from the JSON file. The `createStory` function first adds a pin to the map based off of the coordinates then creates a div element and sets the values for the story fields. Last, it adds the story to the side panel.

Updated the design of the story cards and made it so that you can scroll through them. Cleaned up the CSS file.

#### June 15, 2020
Redesigned the structure of the code. Moved pin create step back into the function where each story is being created. Added an event listener to each pin for mouseenter and mouseleave so that the corresponding story is highlighted.

Lots of work between now and then.

- The pin turns black when the story is selected
- A popup is tied to each pin that includes a link to the news story
- The story has a subtle indicator when the user hovers over the map pin

#### Final
Website requests the day's top stories from the New York Times API, creates an array with the stories that include a location name, and then requests the latitude and longitude from the Mapbox geocoding API. The JSON file is then used to create the story cards and map pins for an always up-to-date map of the top New York Times stories of the day.
