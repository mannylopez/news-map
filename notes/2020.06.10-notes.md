Four options for how to move forward:

1. Use Fetch and work with promises
2. Include js in the data file. This is as small a change as adding `let STORIES = {...}` and then call in the JS file in the html
  - Seems hacky
3. Go down the rabbit hole of using node.js to import
  - Totally legit way of doing it, but would add more than just basic js to the project
  - Read [Stop reading JSON files with require
](https://goenning.net/2016/04/14/stop-reading-json-files-with-require/)
4. Continue researching: `import`
  - Maybe Chrome v83 does not support it because I get `Cannot use import statement outside a module` in the console.
5. Just include the data object in the scripts.js file
  - This would work, for sure

Going with promises

### To do
- [ ] Fetch geojson
- [ ] Store latitude and longitude in an object/array
- [ ] Place pins on map with those points
