#### To do
- [x] Add Mapbox map

## Work log

> 3:42 PM

Open up mapbox to see how to add a map

> 4:31 PM

Used Mapbox GL JS [Display a map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map/) code example. 

#### Learnings:

Need to call `<script src="js/scripts.js"></script>` at the end of the HTML file. I was creating the map before finishing loading the Stories panel. This caused the map to not be centered on Portland and for the map attribution to be off the map.

Calling `<script src="js/scripts.js"></script>` in the middle of the HTML:

![2020.06.07 Map loading before layout bug.png](.././img/2020.06.07-Map-loading-before-layout-bug.png)

Calling `<script src="js/scripts.js"></script>` at the end of the HTML, after the layout has finished loading:

![2020.06.07 Map in map pane](.././img/2020.06.07-Map-in-map-pane.png)

#### Bug?
