Last night, I pushed my code to github and Fetch was not loading the geojson file. This worked for me locally, but not on gh-pages

![2020.06.09-Incorrect-path-github-pages.png](../img/2020.06.09-Incorrect-path-github-pages.png)

Spent some time with the help of a co-worker to get to the bottom of this. I was doing a couple of things wrong. 

The file that was being called by fetch was `https://mannylopez.github.io/data/stories.geojson` and not `https://mannylopez.github.io/news-map/data/stories.geojson`

This is because I was running `python3 -m http.server` _inside_ of my news-map directory. I moved it out of news-map and into my Projects directory. This acts more like what gh-pages is: `mannylopez.github.com/...` and I added `news-map/data/stories.geojson` to Fetch, and now it works.

Now, I want to figure out how to assign a variable to the geojson so that I can pull out the information, use that information to add a pin to a map, and populate the fields for the story.

### To do
- [ ] Fetch geojson
- [ ] Store latitude and longitude in an object/array
- [ ] Place pins on map with those points

#### Test: 

1. 
```
let STORIES = '';
// Load stories.geojson file from the data directory
fetch('/news-map/data/stories.geojson')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => STORIES = data)
  .then(() => console.log(STORIES));
```
typeof = Object

Tried using `async` to create a function that returns the json to then store it in a variable. 

Resource: StackOverflow[Fetch: set variable with fetch response and return from function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38869197/fetch-set-variable-with-fetch-response-and-return-from-function)

Did not work - the browser gets stuck on `async` in the js file. The map does not load nor is the object pulled in.

#### Synchronous vs asynchronous calls, ES2017+ Promises with `async/await`, and ES2015+ Promises with `then()`

Looks like it's time to learn about synchronous vs asynchronous calls, ES2017+ Promises with `async/await`, and ES2015+ Promises with `then()`

Stack OverFlow resource: [How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14220321/how-do-i-return-the-response-from-an-asynchronous-call)

- Synchronous: Everything executes in order, from top to bottom, and the next piece of code can't start untel the one before it finishes.

- Asynchronous: The next piece of code starts as soon as the one before it finishes, but the catch is that it does not need to finish for the result. There is also something here called a _call back_.

Using the code example in stackoverflow [Fetch: set variable with fetch response and return from function](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38869483), tried to return the promise chain created in the function and return the json in a variable storyThing. Did not work. Or it does, but I dont't to do all of the work inside of `.then`

```
// Return the promise chain created in the function and return the json in a variable storyThing
function storyObject() {
  return fetch('/news-map/data/stories.geojson')
   .then((response) => {
    if(response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
        throw new Error('Server response wasn\'t OK');
   }
 })
   .then((json) => {
      let storyThing = json;
      console.log(storyThing)
      return storyThing;
   })
};

// Calll this
storyObject().then((storyThing) => console.log(storyThing))
//This does not work. Variable storyThing is not defined. It only exists inside of the .then
console.log(storyThing)
```

Not finishing in a good spot. Calling it quits for tonight. Maybe Fetch or async is not the way to go here because I can't access the object outside of the `.then` promise or in an async function. Maybe I should try to figure out how to import the `stories.geojson` file with npm or something. The `scripts.js` file is a mess! I'll clean it up tomorrow.
