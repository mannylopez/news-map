#### To Do

- [x] Open story link in new tab
- [ ] CSS
    - [ ] Read up on flexbox CSS
    - [ ] Fix the existing stories pane to take in stories of different sizes
    - [ ] Pretty story card
    - [ ] Change font
- [ ] Connect marker to story

> 2:48 PM

Open link in new tab by adding `storyLink.setAttribute('target', "_blank");`

> 2:53 PM

Now that all the data is loaded into the `story` div, I can work on making it look well designed.

How do other news sites do it?

#### _The Economist_

#### _The New York Times_

#### _Portland Mercury_

#### _Willamette Week_

For comparison, news map today

So I can only really go up from here.

All of the titles don't look like links, so I'll remove the underline and blue text. I'll add the underline back in when the mouse hovers over the title.
