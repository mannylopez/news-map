Pretty happy with the look, feel, and functionality of the website, so now it's time to start looking for a data source to plug in news stories. For development, I've been using a JSON file with 10 stories that I found and filled out the information for. Hopefully I find an API that has location in the response.

#### New York Times

[The New York Times Developer Network](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

_All the APIs Fit to POST_

- Has location: Yes
```
"geo_facet": [
  "Tucson (Ariz)"
]
```
- Since it's not local news, the location is mostly at the state or country level. 

#### Bing News Search
- Has location: No

#### News API
- Has location: No
